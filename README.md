# 📊 Sales Data Analysis

This is a project where I analyzed a sample sales dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal is to understand sales patterns, find top products, and see which regions perform best.

## 🔎 What I Did
- Looked at the dataset and explored the numbers.  
- Made charts to see which product lines and countries bring the most sales.  
- Wrote simple insights in plain language.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Most sales happen in **USA**, followed by France and Spain.  
- Sales go up a lot near the **end of the year (holiday season)**.
